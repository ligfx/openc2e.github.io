<span class="enlarge">alpha 0.1 <i>"peril"</i> - May 1st, 2008</span>
<p>This is the <b>first public release</b> of openc2e.  It is intended primarily as a preview of things
to come- it is <b>not</b> by any means feature complete yet.  The main focus of this release was <b>Creatures 1</b>,
and as a result, of the several games you can expect it to generally work the best.  However, please
<b>do not expect all of Creatures 2, Creatures 3, and Docking Station to work, and do not bother reporting
bugs relating to these games yet</b> (and in particular, relating to the creatures themselves) as we are well
aware that many features of those games are broken or currently lacking.</p>
