<span class="enlarge">When will openc2e be "done"?</span>
<p>We're not sure.  We are constantly working to improve it to the point where it can emulate all
Creatures games, and at that point, who knows?  We may decide that we want to add more features or
find other creative ways to add to the experience.</p>
<p>If you mean "done" in the sense of "when are you going to release something new for me to try?", then
unfortunately we have no specifics for you.  Rest assured, however, that we are working toward
a point where a public release is possible.</p>

<span class="enlarge">I found a bug!  What do I do?</span>
<p>Great!  But before you rush off to tell us, make sure to read the <a href="about">About</a> page
for the current statuses for the various games - some things just plain don't work well right now.
Next, go visit our <a href="http://code.google.com/p/openc2e/issues/list">bug tracker</a> at Google
Code.  Read the list of bugs carefully to make sure the one you've found isn't already there.  If
it isn't please feel free to file a bug using your Google account.  Alternatively, join our IRC
channel (#ccdevnet on <a href="http://freenode.net">Freenode</a>) to let us know what's going on (but
again, please ensure that it's something we don't already know).</p>

<span class="enlarge">Is this a free version of Creatures?</span>

<p>No, we can't provide that.  You still need to buy (or in DS's case, download) the games to run them
  with openc2e. Windows versions (containing the data files necessary for openc2e on any platform) can
  be obtained from various online stores (try Amazon.com or eBay), and Docking Station can
  be downloaded <a href="http://www.gamewaredevelopment.co.uk/ds/">here</a>. You can also use data files
  from the Mac or Linux versions of the games - see the next couple of questions for where to get those.
</p>
<p>However, openc2e is the basis for another Creatures Development Network project,
<a href="lifandi">Lifandi</a>.
And of course, the option of making your own game is always available...</p>

<span class="enlarge">What do I do if I just want to run the games on Linux, without openc2e?</span>

<p>The only game natively available for Linux is <b>Creatures Internet Edition</b>, a combination of Creatures 3
and the Docking Station add-on. You can download the Docking Station portion for free (although it can
be played as a standalone game, it is often considered a 'demo') and buy
the full thing over at <a href="http://www.tuxgames.com/details.cgi?&amp;gameref=82&amp;referrer=openc2e">Tux Games</a>, amongst other places.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can find information about running the Windows Creatures games on Linux at the
<a href="http://creatures.wikia.com/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> page of the Creatures Wiki.</p>

<span class="enlarge">What do I do if I just want to run the games on Mac, without openc2e?</span>

<p>You can get Kutoka's Mac OS X ports of both <b>Creatures Exodus</b> (Creatures 3 and Docking Station)
<a href="http://www.kutoka.com/xcart/catalog/index.html">directly from Kutoka</a> if you live in the
US or Canada.  You can also purchase it from Amazon.com, or try to find copies on eBay or other online
auction sites.</p>
<p>You can find more information about running Creatures games on Mac at the
<a href="http://creatures.wikia.com/wiki/Mac">Mac</a> page of the Creatures Wiki.</p>
