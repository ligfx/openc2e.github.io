Released for [CCSF 2021](https://ccsf2021.tumblr.com/post/670239247947677696/thank-you-to-ligfx-for-making-the-new-mngplayer2)!

A brand-new tool for playing MNG music files. This tool's been built from scratch using openc2e's music code and will work on modern Windows computers without any fudging about.

Additionally, it has a MNG compiler/decompiler built in for any agenteers who want to experiment with custom music.
