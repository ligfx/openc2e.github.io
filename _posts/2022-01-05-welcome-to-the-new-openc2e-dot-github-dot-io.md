Happy New Year, and welcome to the revamped openc2e website! This space will be, essentially, a development diary. I plan to write about Creatures implementation details, C++ programming, highlight old Creatures reverse-engineering sites, and provide tools and tips for working with Creatures.

I've also archived all of the old content (what I could find from archive.org, at least) under the "<a href="/old">Old website</a>" link in the sidebar. Feel free to browse through to see what openc2e.org looked like 14 years ago!

Be sure to watch this space for further announcements!
